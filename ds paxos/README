Paxos implementation for a council to agree on a message by consensus

Council arguments
Council <port number>
Member arguments
Member <What member (M1,M2,M3,M4-9)> <port number>

Test cases:
    Each test case will output if the concensus was agreed or not to output.txt and will be compared to test<number>_actual_output.txt

If test cases error states the "Address already in use", write in terminal: 
    1. lsof -i: <Enter port number in test case file>
    2. kill -9 <Enter PID that has the tag (LISTEN)>

Test cases description:
    test.sh:  - M2 will make a proposal 
              - The response of the proposal will be very late (4s delayed response) and would not understand the proposal
              - The output in output.txt will be "Consensus failed"

    test1.sh: - M3 will make a proposal 
              - M3 would not recieve the proposal
              - The output in output.txt will be "Consensus failed"

    test2.sh: - M6 will make a proposal
              - The response time will be unknown (will be printed) and would accept the proposal
              - The output in output.txt will be "Consensus passed"
            
    test3.sh: - M9 will make a proposal
              - The response time will be unknown (will be printed) and would not accept the proposal
              - The output in output.txt will be "Consensus failed"

    test4.sh: - M1 and M4 will make proposals
              - M4 response time will be unknown (will be printed) and would not accept the proposal itself has proposed as it already accepted M1 proposal
              - The output in output.txt will be "Consensus passed"

    test5.sh: - One of the members from M1-M9 will make a proposal and they will all accept the proposal
              - All members will have immediate responses to voting queries
