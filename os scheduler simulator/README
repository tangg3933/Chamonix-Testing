OS scheduler simulator simulating a slot machine being used by multiple customers with different priorities. Priority determines which customer are allowed to use the machine


Script desription:
baseline.cpp
Original scheduler that schedules customers to play with Round Robin

scheduler.cpp
Modified scheduler that schedules customer by their priority and with Shortest remaining playing time

compute_stats.cpp 
Compare the measured attributes 


Follow these 2 steps below to create a test file

Type each following commands in the steps to a terminal that is in the same directory as the create_test.cpp file. After Step 2, a data_test.txt file should appear containing the randomly generated tests.

Step #1: Compilation
g++ create_test.cpp -o create_test

Step #2: Execution
./create_test data_test.txt


Run scripts:
./scheduler <input data file> <output file>
./compute_stats <original data file> <output data file produced from scheduler>
